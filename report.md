Their online presence indicates a strong connection to New York City, a deep interest in strategy and simulation games, and a curiosity about emerging technologies like AI, tempered by a degree of skepticism towards certain trends (NFTs, AI video manipulation).

Detailed Persona:

Demographics:
*   **Location Indicators:** New York City.
    *   Evidence: Frequent participation in NYC-specific subreddits including r/newyorkcity, r/FoodNYC, r/AskNYC, and r/nycrail.
    *   Citations: [r/newyorkcity - 1lykkqf: "I feel violated by intern season... I'm also a transient being in the city."], [r/FoodNYC - mxxhvpf: (Comment in thread about NYC food)], [r/AskNYC - mexk4g8: (Comment in thread about NYC)], [r/nycrail - mt02ziy: (Comment in thread about NYC rail)]
    *   Confidence: High
*   **Occupation Clues:** Potentially involved in a field impacted by "intern season" or competitive hiring, possibly in a professional or tech-adjacent role given interest in AI/coding. The term "transient being in the city" suggests they might not be a long-term, settled resident or could be in a career phase involving mobility.
    *   Evidence: Post title and content mentioning "intern season" and feeling "transient".
    *   Citations: [r/newyorkcity - 1lykkqf: "I feel violated by intern season"], [r/newyorkcity - 1lykkqf: "Am I not the same as they are, just at a longer time horizon? I'm also a transient being in the city."]
    *   Confidence: Medium (Inferred from a single post)
*   **Age Range:** Difficult to determine precisely, but the mention of "Millenials" and providing a sociological perspective, combined with discussing career phases and "intern season," might suggest they are likely an adult, perhaps in their late 20s or 30s.
    *   Evidence: Comment discussing Millennial behavior.
    *   Citations: [r/AskReddit - mv2xf3q: "Millenials have less kids, so they have more time and money to spend on themselves. Millenials are also getting married less and later in life, meaning we allocate more effort on self care"]

Confidence Levels:
Confidence levels for characteristics are assigned based on the frequency and strength of evidence. High confidence indicates multiple supporting data points or a very clear statement. Medium confidence indicates support from one or a few data points, or interpretation required. Low confidence indicates speculative inference.

Methodology Notes:
This persona was constructed by analyzing public Reddit activity (posts and comments) of the user 'kojied' over approximately the last 6 months (January 14, 2025, to July 14, 2025). Data included post/comment text, associated subreddits, timestamps, and interaction metrics (karma). The analysis focused on identifying recurring themes, behavioral patterns, expressed sentiments, and demographic indicators within the content. Characteristics are supported by direct citations to the original Reddit content. Due to the limited nature of the data (only 1 post and 26 comments in the timeframe), some aspects of the persona, particularly demographics and deep-seated motivations, are based on inference and have lower confidence levels.
